Python and C++ implementations of the simulation of cosmic ray propagation in the Galaxy
by spatially and temporally discrete sources. The Be version is specific for studying the energy
dependence of the Be-10/Be-9 ratio and includes calculations of Carbon, Beryllium-10, and Beryllium-9
production in the sources. The other versions simply compute the time evolution of the total energy density
of cosmic rays.
